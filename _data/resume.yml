    title: A modern approach to using RESTful APIs in Android applications
    summary: The goal of this one-day workshop was to provide insight into modern and efficient ways of connecting Android applications to servers by making HTTP requests to RESTful APIs. We started with a base project where we replaced the HttpUrlConnection client with OkHttp, the manual deserialisation with GSON, and then we added Retrofit. 30 young programmers were present at the workshop, from the total of 62 which registered.
